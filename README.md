## About Me

I design and build digital products that solve real problems.

My focus is not just writing code — it's building systems that are scalable, intentional, and user-centric. From machine learning applications to full-stack web platforms, I care about clarity, performance, and real-world impact.

🚀 **Founder of Lucent** — a modern web studio creating high-performance websites for businesses and creators.

🧠 Currently working on:
- AI-powered applications  
- Scalable backend systems  
- Advanced React architecture  
- Automation tools that eliminate repetitive work

## What I Believe In

- Clean architecture over quick hacks  
- Simplicity over unnecessary complexity  
- Building products, not just projects  
- Continuous learning and iteration
